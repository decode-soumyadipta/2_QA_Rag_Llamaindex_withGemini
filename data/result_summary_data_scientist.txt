Result Summary – Data Scientist

I am a Data Scientist with a strong focus on Generative AI and modern ML systems.
My work involves building end-to-end RAG pipelines, vector databases, and
LLM-powered applications using tools like LlamaIndex and Gemini.

Key strengths include data analysis, machine learning, deep learning,
prompt engineering, and scalable AI system design. I am particularly
interested in applying GenAI to real-world problem solving and intelligent automation.
